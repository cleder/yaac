A Delphi Games Creator breakoutstyle game with full source and a level editor.
The zip-file contains the game, source, level editor and a bit of documentation.
It does add some new features to the genre, like gravity and a 4 directional paddle.
77 Levels included.

This is a very old game of mine, which I always wanted to convert to python.
Before it vanishes I thought it would be a good idea to move it to github.

It is known to work on Microsoft Windows up to 2000 and IIRC it compiles
with Delphi 3 and Delphi 4 (I did mention it is a VERY old game didn't I)
I also got it running with some issues on Ubuntu 12.04 with Wine but ymmv.

As DGC is required and in the past years I almost thought this was lost too
and just found it again I included a copy here.
