A Delphi Games Creator breakoutstyle game with full source and a level editor. The zip-file contains the game, source, level editor and a bit of documentation. It does add some new features to the genre, like gravity and a 4 directional paddle. 77 Levels included.

This is a very old game of mine, which I always wanted to convert to python. before it vanishes I thought it would be a good idea to move it to github.
