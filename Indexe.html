  YaAC the game
</H1>
<P>
YaAC - Yet another Arcanoid Clone -&nbsp;is a Breakout/Arcanoid style game.
All you got to do is to hit the bricks with the ball. When you destroyed
all the bricks a level is finished. You move your paddle with the mouse.
The stronger you hit the ball the higher is the acceleration. Real simple,
so get going.

<CITE>Christian Ledermann send in a Delphi Games Creator breakoutstyle game
with full source AND a level editor. The ZIP File contains the game, source,
level editor and a bit of <A HREF="Index.html">german documentation</A>.
Christian does add a few features to the genre, like gravity and a 4 directional
paddle. It's a great example of a hobbyist programmer expanding a style.</CITE>

To recompile YaAC you will need Delphi 3 (or higher) and the
<A HREF="http://info.ex.ac.uk/~PMBearne/DGC.html">DGC</A> components. Direct
input is handled in the unit
<A HREF="http://www.delphi-jedi.org/DelphiGraphics/DirectX/DISimple.zip">DirectInputAS</A>
which you will find on <A HREF="http://www.delphi-jedi.org/">Delphi-Jedi

want to create your own levels. The Editor is still in an (early) beta stage
but I think it is OK for a start.
<P>
  <HR>
<H2>
  Installation
</H2>
<P>
Just copy the files YAAC.EXE and YAAC.HCL into a directory of your choice.
That's all, no further setup needed.
<H2>
  System requirements
</H2>
<P>
In order to play YaAC you will need a more or less up to date hard and software.
Minimum is a Pentium 166 a Video Card that can display 640 * 480 in HiColor
(16 bit), a direct sound compatible soundcard and a mouse. It runs with Window
9X with DirectX 6.1 or later. (I did not test it but I assume it will run
on Windows ME and Win 2000)
<H2>
  Controls
</H2>
<P>
You operate the paddle with your mouse (any questions?).
<P>
Press "<B>N</B>" to start a <B>n</B>ew game, "<B>S</B>" <B>s</B>aves the
current game&nbsp;(well actually only your score and the number of the level
you are in, but not the state of the current level), "<B>L</B>" loads a previous
saved game, "<B>P</B>" pauses the game, "<B>Z</B>" shows the HiScores and
"<B>ESC</B>" ends the game. There are <B>C</B>heats of course but you will
have to find them yourself (have a look at the code).
<H2>
  Status display
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Ball01.gif" ALT="Ball" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16"> the &nbsp;number
of balls left are displayed on the lower edge of the screen
<P>
<IMG SRC="G10.gif" ALT="Schwerkraft" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="24">In the left upper
corner of the screen the current G-force is displayed.
<P>
<IMG SRC="4x.gif" ALT="3x" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="24">If you are lucky all your
points will score 2,3, or 4 times the value of the bricks.
<P>
And of course your score and the number of the current level is displayed
<H2>
  The Bricks
</H2>
<P>
Every kind of brick has its own features. some of them are massive and cannot
be destroyed, others break at first contact, and some of them you have to
hit several times in order to get rid of them. Bricks may cause actions such
as switching on or of the g-force, accelerating or decelerating the ball
or giving you a bigger paddle. Some Bricks may not be destroyed by the ball
but with your paddle other bricks will destroy your paddle when you touch
them. Magnetic bricks will have an (fatal???) attraction to your ball, teleporter
will beam your ball to another place.
<P>
In a few of the Levels your bricks will get alive, so that every 0.7 seconds
you will have to deal with the next generation of bricks (based on the LIFE
2-3-3 algorithm).

  BUGs
</H2>
<P>
I am sure that there still are a few. If you catch one drop me an
&nbsp;<A HREF="mailto: cleder@dcsnet.de">e-mail</A>!
<H3>
  Known Bugs and issues:
</H3>
<P>
Tabbing away to another application will sometimes crash the game (fortunately
not the system). If you have problems with your taskbar try leftclicking
the mouse or change the properties of your taskbar. If you do not have a
soundcard, YaAC will crash :-(((.
<P>
  <HR>
<H2>
  Building your own levels
</H2>
<P>
Like every other good game YaAC comes with an leveleditor, that enables you
to create your own levels, or modify existing Levels.
<P>
Levels above level 26 are meant to be modified. Have a look at all the levels
and do not make your own levels to complicated or to easy.
<P>
Just start YaACMapEdtor and get going.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  A short introduction to the LevelEditor
</H3>
<P>
The level editor is optimized &nbsp;(i.e. you do not need to load the graphic
library) to work with YaAC Levels but you may use it for any kind of map
you created with the DGC MAP EDITOR
<P>
<I>features written in italics are not yet implemented</I>
<H6>
  Icons
</H6>
<H6>
  Main Bar
</H6>
<P>
Most of the icons should be self explanatory. The Main Icon bar contains
4 icons. These icons are used to create a new library, open an existing library,
save the current library, and load in an Image Library to use as tiles.
<P>
You can use the scroll bars to move around if you wish.
<P>
The Clear Map icon allows you to clean a map. This action will use the currently
selected tile as the clearing tile.
<P>
The Map Properties Icon will allow you to change the basic properties of
the current map. You can rename a map with this option.
<P>
The Remap Tile icon will allow you to change all references to a tile to
another tile.
<P>
The Transparency Icon (toggle) will allow you to view the map over a background
color so that you can get a rough idea on what the map will look like when
drawn in the game.
<P>
The Grid Lines Icon (toggle) will turn on/off grid lines. This may make it
easier for you when drawing your maps, especially with smaller tiles.
<P>
The Color Block allows you to change the Transparent color used for viewing
in transparency mode.
<P>
The Zoom Percentage selector allows you to view/edit your map at different
levels of zoom. 100% is normal. You can select a lower amount to fit more
of the map on the screen or a higher value if you need to look at the map
up close.
<H6>
  Tile Bar
</H6>
<P>
On top of the tile bar is a single tile display which shows the currently
selected tile. You can select a tile to draw with by clicking on it in the
tile bar.
<P>
Note: While working on a map, you can click the right mouse button on a tile
in your map to switch to that tile saving you a small amount of time.
<H6>
  Library Bar
</H6>
<P>
<I>The Library Bar has four Icons. The first Icon is used to add a new map
to the library. The second is used to delete a map from the library. You
can arrange the order of the maps by using the last two icons.</I>
<H6>
  Status Bar
</H6>
<P>
The Status Bar shows some basic details about the map you are working on.
In the first pane, you will see the name of the map library that you are
working on. The second pane is the map index that you are working on. The
third pane displays the size of the map. The fourth pane shows the current
cursor position on the map and the fifth pane shows the current tile under
the cursor.
<H6>
  Menu Items
</H6>
<P>
Most of the menu items have a corresponding Icon.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
Please be sure you follow this basic rules when designing a new Level:
<P>
Please do not modify the first level (Index 0), It is used internally as
a startupscreen.
<P>
The first and the last rows of each level are used for the display of status
information etc. I recommend not to alter these rows unless you know what
you are doing.
<P>
The contents of the first row is.
<OL>
  <LI>
    G-Force
  <LI>
    Multiplikator
  <LI>
    1. LIFE-Stone
  <LI>
    2. LIFE-Stone
  <LI>
    3. LIFE-Stone
  <LI>
    High-Score
  <LI>
    Level
</OL>
<P>
The last row displays the balls you have left. Any tile you place here will
be overwritten.
<P>
There can be only one active magnet per level. When it is destroyed the next
magnet gets active.
<P>
In each level you have to define a starting point for your ball and your
paddle. If you do not define these point you will get a LIFE Level (and I
do mean that, The algorithm it is based on is the good old Life 2-3-3)
<P>
If you want to design a LIFE-Level be aware of the following: The bricks
in the rows, columns 0 and 19 will not die at a generation Change regardless
how many other bricks are around them. In the Columns 3, 4 and 5 of the uppermost
row (0) you may place the tiles that determine the kind of respawning bricks.
No tile means that a simple brick will appear.
<P>
Backgrounds &nbsp;and animations are stored in the YaAC.HCL - DGC HI-COLOR
IMAGE LIBRARY. To change them you will need the DGC HI-COLOR IMAGE LIBRARY
EDITOR. If you want a starfield instead of a static background just change
the image of the according level into a 1 by 1 pixel image (the index for
the background is currently 36 + Level)
<P>
If you design a level that you think is real cool send it to me. I will include
it in the next release of YaAC.
<P>
  <HR>
<H2>
  To Do
</H2>
<P>
I still think of YaAC as a BETA Release, but meanwhile at least most of the
bugs are fixed and it runs stable on almost every machine that meets the
system requirements. Leveldesign is still a major issue but that's what the
level editor is for.
<H3>
  Animations and graphics
</H3>
<P>
I do think I am better at programming than at graphic design. So if you have
ideas how i could make YaAC look better, or some animations you would like
to add to YaAC please do not hesitate to contact me.
<H3>
  Sounds
</H3>
<P>
I did not yet do any kind of real sound design or implemented &nbsp;background
music (the DGCMidi Component is not yet working with Delphi 3 any suggestions?).
I thought about adjusting the sounds to the speed of the ball (the higher
the velocity of the ball the louder the sound when it hits a brick) or giving
the sound a stereo effect depending &nbsp;on where the sound originates.
<H3>
  New Bricks
</H3>
<P>
There are some ideas for new kinds of bricks already:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Invisible Bricks
  <LI>
    Bricks that set other bricks on fire while they burn
  <LI>
    undestroyable magnets and teleporters
  <LI>
    a rubberband Brick, that accelerates the Ball the more the further it gets
    away from the brick
  <LI>
    a brick that toggles the direction of the paddle.
  <LI>
    a brick that will accelerate your mouse moves
  <LI>
    wind bricks, with a force field in a specific direction thus blowing the
    ball away from them
  <LI>
    a brick that blocks the Ball but not the paddle.
  <LI>
    bricks that kill the Ball
</UL>
<H3>
  Force-Feedback
</H3>
<P>
As soon as I get a new computer or at least a Forcefeedback joystick I think
this will be a major issue for future releases.
<H3>
  Level
</H3>
<P>
And of course more and more refined levels. A Map Library can store up to
255 Levels....
<P>
So there are a lot of &nbsp;ideas for future releases. Please give me a
<A HREF="mailto: cleder@dcsnet.de">feedback </A>&nbsp; what you think about
my little game, what sucks and what features you want to have implemented
in future versions, or implement a version of your own ;-)
<P>
to be continued....
